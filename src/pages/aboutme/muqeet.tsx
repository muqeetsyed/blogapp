                        <h2>📚 Current Focus</h2>
                        <p>
                            As a full-stack developer, my current focus lies in crafting
                            robust and scalable enterprise-level applications. Leveraging
                            Symfony API Platform for backend development, I specialize in
                            creating RESTful and GraphQL APIs that integrate seamlessly with
                            modern frontend frameworks like React. On the frontend, I strive
                            to deliver responsive and dynamic user experiences using React and
                            TypeScript, ensuring accessibility and performance. For deployment
                            and infrastructure, I employ Docker and NixOS, streamlining
                            workflows for development and production environments.
                            Additionally, I am actively exploring advanced authentication
                            methods, such as JWT, and enhancing ERP systems for greater
                            efficiency and adaptability. My ultimate goal is to align
                            cutting-edge technologies with business needs to provide impactful
                            and sustainable solutions.

                        <h2>🌱 Always Learning</h2>
                        <p>
                            I thrive on continuous learning, staying curious and adaptive in
                            the fast-evolving tech landscape. My focus extends from mastering
                            tools like React, GraphQL, and Docker to exploring emerging fields
                            like AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I am passionate
                            about leveraging these technologies to build smarter, more
                            impactful solutions while growing both technically and
                            collaboratively. Learning isn’t just a task—it’s a mindset that
                            fuels my drive to innovate and excel.
